The "Even or Odd Checker" is a simple C++ program that helps users determine whether a given number is even or odd. The program takes an integer input from the user and uses basic conditional logic to check the number's divisibility by 2.

How it works:
The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
It then divides the number by 2 and checks the remainder.
If the remainder is 0, the number is even.
If the remainder is 1, the number is odd.
The result (either "Even" or "Odd") is displayed on the screen.
Features:
Input Handling: The program accepts user input from the console.
Conditional Statements: It uses an if statement to check the condition for even or odd.
Clear Output: It provides a clear message to the user about the nature of the number (even or odd).
